There is a play and pause button

Each circle represents one note

each column plays at once

each row represents a different tone

clicking a circle fills in the color

if a circle is filled in and the synth is playing, the respective tone will play on the respective beat (column)

after the last column, the process repeats until the user stops it

when two horizontally adjecent circles are filled in, there is no break in the sound

if an entire row is filled, that tone drones

(each tone plays continuously and is just muted when unclicked. so each button is an on/off for a set amount of time...) -> use some kind of framework / web audio api

build an oscillator, don't use samples because they will lag depending on connection
the buttons are sequencer steps
